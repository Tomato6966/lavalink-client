### Skip Broken-Tracks

Some tracks are broken by not containing duration or broken duration. Due to the nature of Flexibility lavalink-client does not handle those scenarios, so you need to check it yourself.
There are utils for that built in, and this is how you could do it:

```ts
const res = await player.search("Adele");

// short hand:
const validTracks = res.tracks.filter(client.lavalink.utils.isNotBrokenTrack)
// or with options:
const validTracks = res.tracks.filter(t => client.lavalink.utils.isNotBrokenTrack(t, 29e3));

// then you can add it to the queue.
await player.queue.add(validTracks);
```
