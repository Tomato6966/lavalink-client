## Update Log

Logs about the changed features.

---

## **Version 2.9.1**

- Introduce a `ManagerOption.playerOptions.allowCustomSources` Option, to allow to use "source" in the search query, which lavalink-client doesn't officially support yet (not in the `DEFAULT_SOURCES` object) This will allow you to make requests to sources, which lavalink-client doesn't support.

- Add JSDoc for all ManagerUtils.
- New ManagerUtils + cleaner source extractions.

## **Version 2.9.0**

- Removed the autoChecks options on the manager:
    - ~~`ManagerOption.autoChecks.pluginValidations`~~ -> Now configured per node: `NodeOption.autoChecks.pluginValidations`
    - ~~`ManagerOption.autoChecks.sourcesValidations`~~ -> Now configured per node: `NodeOption.autoChecks.sourcesValidations`

- Added autoChecks options for every single node:
    - `NodeOption.autoChecks.pluginValidations` ... default is true, set to false if you want to skip plugin validations (if nodeType === "NodeLink" then this will always be false)
    - `NodeOption.autoChecks.sourcesValidations` ... default is true, set to false if you want to skip sources/filters validations

- Implemented a seperate class for other Audio nodes, atm just a seperate "NodeLink" class.

- Added nodeOptions.nodeType to check if the node is a "NodeLink" or "Lavalink" (default: "Lavalink") node. (setable via nodeOptions.nodeType)
    - If nodeType = NodeLink, the NodeClass will be NodeLinkNode instead of LavalinkNode.

- Added a Manager.lavalinkManager.getNode() function, to typed-return a node if you are looking for one.

- Added public options for the autoChecks on node: `_checkForPlugins` and `_checkForSourcesAndFilters`
    - `_checkForPlugins` ... default is true, set to false if you want to skip plugin validations (if nodeType === "NodeLink" then this will always be false)
    - `_checkForSourcesAndFilters` ... default is true, set to false if you want to skip sources/filters validations (if nodeType === "NodeLink" then this will always be false)

- Removed eslint + standard resolvers, and instead utilize oxlint and oxfmt and oxc-resolver.

- Enhanced connection stability feature (heartbeating) is now only available for nodeType = "Lavalink".

- Expose `node.rawRequest` to public, so you can use it for your own requests.

- Added all nodelink specific features (in the seperate NodeLinkNode class, which can be type asserted via `node.isNodeLink()`):

- Nodelink hasn't been fully tested yet, so expect some potential issues/bugs, please test, report and open issues at: https://github.com/Tomato6966/lavalink-client/issues

## **Version 2.8.0**

- Added global typing for the TrackRequester type via `module augmentation`. ( Thanks to @appujet on Github)
- Added information for Nodelink Users on how to disable heartbeat system in the readme.
- Fixed typos in the jsdoc documentation

Example for TrackRequester augmentation:

```ts
declare module "lavalink-client" {
    export interface TrackRequester {
        id: string;
        username: string;
        avatarURL: string;
    }
}
```

New Queue Utilities:

- Added `player.queue.utils.filterTracks({ ... })` to clear the previous tracks array.
- Added `player.queue.utils.findTrack({ ... })` to find a specific track of the queue.
- Added `player.queue.toSortedBy({ ... })` to get a new array of tracks sorted by specific properties.

Thanks to @notinsane-dev on Github: https://github.com/Tomato6966/lavalink-client/pull/164

## **Version 2.7.7**

- Added `node.on("nodeLinkEvent", node, eventName, player, track, payload)` to handle nodelink events.

Example:

```ts
this.nodeManager.on("nodeLinkEvent", (node, event, player, track, payload) => {
    if (event === "SeekEvent") {
        console.log("new position:", payload.position);
    }
    if (event === "FiltersChangedEvent") {
        console.log("new filters state", payload.filters);
    }
});
```

It is fully typed and generic, so you get code completion + type security based on the event Name.
Why not many different events?`

- This way the client does not get bloated, as nodelink is not the primary focus of this client.

## **Version 2.7.6**

More NodeLink Specific / additional features added, in case you are using NodeLink.

- Added `node.fetchConnectionMetrics()`, which returns the connection metrics of the node.
- Added `node.info.isNodelink` to check whether the node is using NodeLink or Lavalink.
- Added `node.stats.detailedStats` to check whether the node is using NodeLink or Lavalink.

## **Version 2.7.5**

- Add some private getters to minify the code a little
- Add new options on the manager:
    - `ManagerOption.autoChecks.pluginValidations` ... default is true, set to false if you want to skip plugin validations
    - `ManagerOption.autoChecks.sourcesValidations` ... default is true, set to false if you want to skip sources/filters validations

## **Version 2.7.4**

- Some nullish issues got fixed by the community

## **Version 2.7.3**

- Fixed an issue where the `lavalink-filter-plugin` reverb filter was not being correctly identified as active in the `Filters` structure.
- Fixed more nullish issues.

## **Version 2.7.2**

Make the node auto-reconnection more solid by a reconnection queue, so we can trigger reconnection tries much easier.
You can check the current state of reconnection by accessing **`node.reconnectionState`** (`"IDLE"` / `"RECONNECTING"` / `"PENDING"` / `"DESTROYING"`)
Alterantivly you can use the getter property to check whether it's pending to reconnect or reconnecting: **`node.isNodeReconnecting`** (easier to use)

Huge thanks to **[@ductridev](https://github.com/ductridev)** who introduced this change in: [Pull #154](https://github.com/Tomato6966/lavalink-client/pull/154)
Enhances the resilience of the LavalinkNode by introducing automatic reconnection attempts on WebSocket errors instead of only emitting error events. The implementation adds a state machine using a new ReconnectionState enum to prevent duplicate reconnection attempts.

Key Changes:

- Added ReconnectionState enum to track reconnection status (IDLE, RECONNECTING, PENDING)
- Refactored reconnect() method to use state guards preventing concurrent reconnection attempts
- Modified error() handler to trigger reconnection directly instead of emitting error events
- there is now a new getter: `node.reconnectionAttemptCount` (which allows you to get the count of the current reconnection attempts, considering the new option `node.options.retryTimespan`)
- Before the `node.reconnectAttempts` was a number-counter. Now it's just an array of Date-Times, to be able to allow Retrys per a timespan (e.g. you can have 20 retries every hour.) - setup able through `node.options.retryTimespan`, on default it's -1. so it behaves as before.
- FIX: Now instead of counting from "1 retry up" it counts from 0 up, means if you set `node.retryAmount` to "1" it actually tries 1 time to retry, and not 0. (issue before)
- New node-event "reconnectinprogress" which is triggered before "reconnecting" is triggered, but "reconnecting" might not be triggered, when the max retryAmount is reached, therefore "reconnectinprogress" exists.

## **Version 2.7.1**

Fixes:

- player.options.voiceChannelId is not updating after playerMove
- checkFiltersState() "cannot read properties of undefined ..." (added conditional chaining + default datas for multiple checks + a new private library for nonnullish checks)
- Bandcamp search crashing when no valid json is returned
- Infinite reconnection loop because this.reconnectAttempts = 1; was not made in the connection-ready.

Additions:

- Added checks for volume + audioOutput Channel checks in checkFilterState function
- Utilities for resetting internal timeouts for easier code readability. (resetReconnectionAttempts & resetAckTimeouts)

Others:

- new Bots in README.md

## **Version 2.7.0**

- BREAKING CHANGE: When using the `queue.remove()` function, the removed tracks are now added via unshift to the queue.previous array instead of push.
    - This means that the order of removed tracks is reversed in the previous array.
    - This was done to maintain consistency with how tracks are added to the previous array when skipped or played.
- Added some conditional chaining and further if statements to make the library more robust.
- Added additional ways of finding the closest track for resolving unresolved tracks. (isrc) and described that process.

if (speed) fttsParams.append("speed", speed);

const response = await player.search(
    {
        // For flowerytts you need to send a URL
        // and if you want to add optiojns, this is how you add the params to the query..
        query: `${encodeURI(query)}${fttsParams.size ? `?${fttsParams.toString()}` : ""}`,

```

---

## **Version 2.4.4 - Version 2.4.6**

- `player.changeNode()` is **fixed and works** - thanks to @PandaIN95
- The code got **re-formatted and re-structured**, no code-changes are needed to be made, but it's now cleaner & more readable in some areas
- The same for the testbot Folder(s), also it imports lavalink-client directly, so you can just copy it and move on from it.
- **Some minor Fixess**:
    - Autoplay sometimes doesn't get called when previousAutoplay call failed.
    - remove structuredClone so that it works in bun more stable
    - Player Options Validation also allows single property objects
    - Some typos were fixed

---

## **Version 2.4.3**

- Added a new debug log for that
- Added the try to play the next track if there is no current track
    - _Fixes a problem where auto-reconnect on-Disconnect while the queue was empty caused the player to get destroyed._

- They also now have individual **state-changing-methods** under `player.filterManager`:
    - `player.filterManager.lavalinkLavaDspxPlugin.toggleEcho(...)`, `.toggleNormalization(...)`, `.toggleHighPass(...)`, `.toggleLowPass(...)`
    - `player.filterManager.lavalinkFilterPlugin.toggleEcho(...)`, `.toggleReverb(...)`

---

## **Version 2.0.0**

- **Lavalink v4 released, adjusted all features to support it\!**
- **Track Loading/Stop Playing has changed (Client handles it automatically)**:

```diff
# Old
- await player.node.updatePlayer({ encodedTrack?: Base64|null, track?: Track|UnresolvedTrack, identifer?: string });
# New
+ await player.node.updatePlayer({ track: { encoded?: Base64|null, identifier?: string }, clientTrack?: Track|UnresolvedTrack });
```

- **Player play function adjusted**:

```diff
# Old
- await player.play({ encodedTrack?: Base64|null, track?: Track|UnresolvedTrack, identifer?: string });
# New
+ await player.play({ track: { encoded?: Base64|null, identifier?: string }, clientTrack?: Track|UnresolvedTrack });
```

- **Node Resuming supported**: Enable with `await player.node.updateSession(true, 360_000);` and use `sessionId` on reconnect.
- **Node Options property adjusted**: `node.resuming: { enabled: boolean, timeout: number | null }`
- **Player function added to stop playing without disconnecting**: `player.stopPlaying(clearQueue:boolean = true, executeAutoplay:boolean = false);`
- **Node functions for SponsorBlock Plugin added**: `deleteSponsorBlock(player:Player)`, `setSponsorBlock(player:Player, segments: ["sponsor", ...])`, `getSponsorBlock(player:Player)`
- **Corresponding nodeManager events added**: `"ChapterStarted"`, `"ChaptersLoaded"`, `"SegmentsLoaded"`, `"SegmentSkipped"`
- **Filters sending supported** for `filters.pluginFilters`
- **Native implementation for lavaSearch plugin officially updated**

- **Lavalink `track.userData` got added** (similar to custom `pluginInfo.clientData`)

---

## **Version 1.2.1**

- **Adjusted `player.stopPlaying()` parameters**: `stopPlaying(clearQueue:boolean = true, executeAutoplay:boolean = false)`.
    - Default behavior is now to clear the queue and not execute Autoplay.
- Fixed that it looped the current track if `repeatmode === "track" / "queue"` when stopping.
- Implemented a **`parseLavalinkConnUrl(connectionUrl:string)` Util Function** to parse connection data from a URL string in the pattern: `lavalink://<nodeId>:<nodeAuthorization(Password)>@<NodeHost>:<NodePort>`.
    - Example: `parseLavalinkConnUrl("lavalink://LavalinkNode_1:strong%23password1@localhost:2345")` returns `{ id: "LavalinkNode_1", authorization: "strong#password1", host: "localhost", port: 2345 }`

---

## **Version 1.2.0**

- Added **`player.stopPlaying()`**: **Clears the Queue** and **stops playing**, **without destroying the Player**
- **Adjusted `Player.skip()`**:
    - Added `throwError` Property: `player.skip(skipTo?:number = 0, throwError?:boolean = true)`.
    - If `throwError = false` and the queue is empty, it won't throw an error (behaves like `stopPlaying`).
- **Added all Events and Methods from the [SponsorBlock Plugin]** (e.g., `player.getSponsorBlock()`, `player.setSponsorBlock()`, `player.deleteSponsorBlock()`).
    - **Manager Events added**: `"SegmentsLoaded"`, `"SegmentSkipped"`, `"ChapterStarted"`, `"ChaptersLoaded"`
- Example Bot shows how to "disable" / "enable" Autoplay with bot data variables.
- Added **`ManagerOptions#emitNewSongsOnly`**: If true, it won't emit the `"trackStart"` Event if track.loop is active or the new current track is the same as the previous one.
- **Added URL/Query Blacklist/Whitelist options to `ManagerOptions`**:
    - **`ManagerOptions#linksBlacklist`** (RegExp/strings to block queries/links)
    - **`ManagerOptions#linksWhitelist`** (RegExp/strings for links only; if no match, request is blocked)
    - **`ManagerOptions#linksAllowed`** (If set to false, blocks all requests that are links)
- **Moved `ManaagerOptions#debugOptions`** to **`ManaagerOptions#advancedOptions.debugOptions`**
