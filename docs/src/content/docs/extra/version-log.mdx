## Update Log

Logs about the changed features.

---

## **Version 2.7.0**

- BREAKING CHANGE: When using the `queue.remove()` function, the removed tracks are now added via unshift to the queue.previous array instead of push.
  - This means that the order of removed tracks is reversed in the previous array.
  - This was done to maintain consistency with how tracks are added to the previous array when skipped or played.
- Added some conditional chaining and further if statements to make the library more robust.
- Added additional ways of finding the closest track for resolving unresolved tracks. (isrc) and described that process.

---

## **Version 2.6.6**

- Fix Error-Typo in the testbot- thanks to @KingKonguido
- Updated Deps and add a nullish check to the queue-remove util - thanks to @LucasB25
- Fix Documentation error for the tipps_and_tricks and the new util "isNotBrokenTrack" & allow UnresolvedTracks - thansk to @appujet

gotta write this versionlog from 2.5.x - 2.6.x ... commits till 2.5.1 https://github.com/Tomato6966/lavalink-client/commit/66289fb0aba996f5ba4adac6ac26ac008bb72105

---

## **Version 2.5.0**

  - Deps got updated
  - Handling of parsing url got updated to use the **URL object**
  - **Flowerytts requests needs to be changed** now:

```js
const query = "Hello World How are you?";
const voice = "Ava";
const speed = "1.0";

const fttsParams = new URLSearchParams();
if(voice) fttsParams.append("voice", voice);
if(speed) fttsParams.append("speed", speed);

const response = await player.search({
    // For flowerytts you need to send a URL
    // and if you want to add optiojns, this is how you add the params to the query..
    query: `${encodeURI(query)}${fttsParams.size ? `?${fttsParams.toString()}` : ""}`,
    source: "ftts"
}, interaction.user);
```

---

## **Version 2.4.4 - Version 2.4.6**

  - `player.changeNode()` is **fixed and works** - thanks to @PandaIN95
  - The code got **re-formatted and re-structured**, no code-changes are needed to be made, but it's now cleaner & more readable in some areas
  - The same for the testbot Folder(s), also it imports lavalink-client directly, so you can just copy it and move on from it.
  - **Some minor Fixess**:
      * Autoplay sometimes doesn't get called when previousAutoplay call failed.
      * remove structuredClone so that it works in bun more stable
      * Player Options Validation also allows single property objects
      * Some typos were fixed

---

## **Version 2.4.3**

  - **`managerOptions#playerOptions.onDisconnect.autoReconnectOnlyWithTracks`** added to control whether to try reconnecting only when there are tracks in the queue / current track or not
  - Added a new debug log for that
  - Added the try to play the next track if there is no current track
      * *Fixes a problem where auto-reconnect on-Disconnect while the queue was empty caused the player to get destroyed.*

---

---

## **Version 2.3.0**

  - Added a **heartbeat + ping-pong system** to check if the client is still connected to the node (auto-reconnect on failure).
  - **New nodeOptions**: `enablePingOnStatsCheck: boolean` (default: true), `heartBeatInterval: number` (default: 30\_000)

---

## **Version 2.2.2**

  - Fixed a bug in **`player.pause()`** where resuming after a long pause could cause an auto-skip.
  - Fixed the handling of the previous track array (sometimes added "null").
  - **Added new queue functions**:
      * **`const previousTrack = await player.queue.shiftPrevious()`**: Removes and returns the previously played track from the `player.queue.previous` array.
      * **`await player.queue.remove(removeQuery)`**: Remove function supporting an array of Tracks/UnresolvedTracks, single Track/UnresolvedTrack, array of track-indexes, or a single track index.
  - Added **`track.pluginInfo.clientData?.previousTrack`** handling to prevent a track from being added to the previous track array.

---

## **Version 2.2.1**

  - **Player position is now calculated instead of using intervals** (removes internal interval for position update).
  - Internal updates for handling query params and url-requests: **You don't have to ever provide stuff encoded via `encodeURIComponent` anymore.**
  - Added a bunch of jsdoc information.
  - **Flowery TTS example updated** to use `extraQueryUrlParams` for dynamic mid-request options:


```js
const extraParams = new URLSearchParams();
if(voice) extraParams.append(`voice`, voice);
// ...
const response = await player.search({
    query: `${query}`,
    extraQueryUrlParams: extraParams,
    source: "ftts"
}, interaction.user);
```

---

## **Version 2.2.0**

  - Added searchPlatform for **local tracks** (files on the lavalink server): **`"local"`**

---

## **Version 2.1.0**

  - Fixed that, if you **skip and have trackloop enabled, it doesn't skip the track**.
  - **Reworked the Filter Manager for custom filters** via [LavalinkFilterPlugin](https://github.com/rohank05/lavalink-filter-plugin) / [LavalinkLavaDSPX-Plugin](https://github.com/devoxin/LavaDSPX-Plugin/).
  - They now have individual **state-variables (booleans)** under `player.filterManager.filters`:
      * `player.filterManager.filters.lavalinkLavaDspxPlugin` (`.echo`, `.normalization`, `.highPass`, `.lowPass`)
      * `player.filterManager.filters.lavalinkFilterPlugin` (`.echo`, `.reverb`)
  - They also now have individual **state-changing-methods** under `player.filterManager`:
      * `player.filterManager.lavalinkLavaDspxPlugin.toggleEcho(...)`, `.toggleNormalization(...)`, `.toggleHighPass(...)`, `.toggleLowPass(...)`

## **Version 2.0.0**

  - **Lavalink v4 released, adjusted all features to support it\!**
  - **Track Loading/Stop Playing has changed (Client handles it automatically)**:


```diff
# Old
- await player.node.updatePlayer({ encodedTrack?: Base64|null, track?: Track|UnresolvedTrack, identifer?: string });
# New
+ await player.node.updatePlayer({ track: { encoded?: Base64|null, identifier?: string }, clientTrack?: Track|UnresolvedTrack });
```

  - **Player play function adjusted**:


```diff
# Old
- await player.play({ encodedTrack?: Base64|null, track?: Track|UnresolvedTrack, identifer?: string });
# New
+ await player.play({ track: { encoded?: Base64|null, identifier?: string }, clientTrack?: Track|UnresolvedTrack });
```

  - **Node Resuming supported**: Enable with `await player.node.updateSession(true, 360_000);` and use `sessionId` on reconnect.
  - **Node Options property adjusted**: `node.resuming: { enabled: boolean, timeout: number | null }`
  - **Player function added to stop playing without disconnecting**: `player.stopPlaying(clearQueue:boolean = true, executeAutoplay:boolean = false);`
  - **Node functions for SponsorBlock Plugin added**: `deleteSponsorBlock(player:Player)`, `setSponsorBlock(player:Player, segments: ["sponsor", ...])`, `getSponsorBlock(player:Player)`
  - **Corresponding nodeManager events added**: `"ChapterStarted"`, `"ChaptersLoaded"`, `"SegmentsLoaded"`, `"SegmentSkipped"`
  - **Filters sending supported** for `filters.pluginFilters`
  - **Native implementation for lavaSearch plugin officially updated**
  - **Native implementation for lavaSrc plugin officially updated** (including floweryTTS)
  - **Lavalink `track.userData` got added** (similar to custom `pluginInfo.clientData`)

---

## **Version 1.2.1**

  - **Adjusted `player.stopPlaying()` parameters**: `stopPlaying(clearQueue:boolean = true, executeAutoplay:boolean = false)`.
      * Default behavior is now to clear the queue and not execute Autoplay.
  - Fixed that it looped the current track if `repeatmode === "track" / "queue"` when stopping.
  - Implemented a **`parseLavalinkConnUrl(connectionUrl:string)` Util Function** to parse connection data from a URL string in the pattern: `lavalink://<nodeId>:<nodeAuthorization(Password)>@<NodeHost>:<NodePort>`.
      * Example: `parseLavalinkConnUrl("lavalink://LavalinkNode_1:strong%23password1@localhost:2345")` returns `{ id: "LavalinkNode_1", authorization: "strong#password1", host: "localhost", port: 2345 }`

---

## **Version 1.2.0**

  - Added **`player.stopPlaying()`**: **Clears the Queue** and **stops playing**, **without destroying the Player**
  - **Adjusted `Player.skip()`**:
      * Added `throwError` Property: `player.skip(skipTo?:number = 0, throwError?:boolean = true)`.
      * If `throwError = false` and the queue is empty, it won't throw an error (behaves like `stopPlaying`).
  - **Added all Events and Methods from the [SponsorBlock Plugin]** (e.g., `player.getSponsorBlock()`, `player.setSponsorBlock()`, `player.deleteSponsorBlock()`).
      * **Manager Events added**: `"SegmentsLoaded"`, `"SegmentSkipped"`, `"ChapterStarted"`, `"ChaptersLoaded"`
  - Example Bot shows how to "disable" / "enable" Autoplay with bot data variables.
  - Added **`ManagerOptions#emitNewSongsOnly`**: If true, it won't emit the `"trackStart"` Event if track.loop is active or the new current track is the same as the previous one.
  - **Added URL/Query Blacklist/Whitelist options to `ManagerOptions`**:
      * **`ManagerOptions#linksBlacklist`** (RegExp/strings to block queries/links)
      * **`ManagerOptions#linksWhitelist`** (RegExp/strings for links only; if no match, request is blocked)
      * **`ManagerOptions#linksAllowed`** (If set to false, blocks all requests that are links)
  - **Moved `ManaagerOptions#debugOptions`** to **`ManaagerOptions#advancedOptions.debugOptions`**
